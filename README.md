# Driving-Instructor-booking-platform


## What my website does:
My website serves as a channel to connect driving instructors with learners, it also
has a personalized dashboard which instructors can leave feedback for instructors.

## The motivation for my application:
My motivation came when i wanted to get my license and the process to get an instructor was a long one and there was no cllear communication between me and the instructors, and they have no schedule they follow, so it felt like throwing money away.

so i set out to create something better.
